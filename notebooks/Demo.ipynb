    "* Read in and clean the data\n",
    "    * in this example we use the 20 newsgropus data which is a good candidate for having train/test contamination, e.g. original emails and replies, repeated email signatures, etc.\n",
    "* Split the data into \"train\" and \"test\" sets\n",
    "    * this is done the typical way if you want to test for train/test contamination, e.g., in this demonstration\n",
    "    * if you are working with a conditional natural language generation model, this will be the train set and the generated set\n",
    "* Perform sentence tokenization and explode\n",
    "    * each sentence becomes a row in the data)\n",
    "    * the original document id is maintained as an attribute\n",
    "* Calculate embeddings on each sentence\n",
    "    * there are many choices, we use an arbitrary one from `sentence_transformers`\n",
